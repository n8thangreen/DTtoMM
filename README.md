# Decision tree to Markov model tutorial

It is a common model structure in health economic modelling and cost-effectiveness analysis to link a decision tree to a Markov model but this is usually done in an ad-hoc fashion.
This leads to less robust, less reusable and more error-prone code.
This tutorial will present several approaches to linking together these types of models, with a range of complexity and generalisability.
Real-life case studies will be used.
